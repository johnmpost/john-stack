- refine context/runtime for effects as a way to provide dependencies to operations
- client-side routing
- composable convenience functions for defining common actions (CRUD, etc) as operations
- auth
- error handling with react-query
- define base paths and stuff
- better handle client `exports` - not globals please, use contexts instead
- set up db migrations
- "actions" reactogen stuff
- define query invalidations on the restless mutation definitions?
