# code

- refine type safety and organization around api index.ts
- client-side routing
- composable convenience functions for defining common actions (CRUD, etc) as operations
- error handling with react-query
- define base paths and stuff
- better handle client `exports` - not globals please, use contexts instead
- "actions" reactogen stuff
- define query invalidations on the restless mutation definitions?
- better logging
- local s3 server
- better manage env file for standard dev setup (maybe just put in readme)

# example app

- multi tenant
- live updates with websockets
- file storage with something s3-compatible
- authorization
